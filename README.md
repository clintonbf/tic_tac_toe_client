# tic_tac_toe_client

Two versions:
* ttt_client: Tic Tac Toe
* rps_client: Rock Paper Scissors

**Note** that python 3 is required. Code was tested with 3.8 but I *think* anything 3.0+ is fine.

#H3 TTT

usage (TTT): 
```python
python3 ttt_client.py [--version v] [--port p] HOST
```

For COMP 3980, final project, use version = 4

#H3 RPS

usage (RPS): 
```python
python3 rps_client.py [--port p] HOST
```

There is no version argument for RPS
